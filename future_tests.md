**Sleep and Recovery:**

This is the largest area of interest for me, especially looking to re-enter the competition scene and being over 30.  Training hard isn't the problem.  Recovering is; and more so as you get older -- not only for injury prevention, but because you're only getting the most out of your training sessions if you're recovered from the last one.  Based on years of tinkering, I feel like my diet is pretty well contained, or certainly leaning towards a point of diminishing returns.

Caffeine is also the last remaining drug I have addiction issues with.  I rarely drink alcohol, even socially, since being a carnivore.  I quit smoking and smokeless tobacco years ago.  I have absolutely no desire to eat junk food -- even the ice cream I love(d?) so much.  I did do a pilot study showing how caffeine impacts sleep.  You can take more drugs (melatonin, CBD, etc...) to counteract the former, but you're in a bad behavior loop if you can't change the root of the issue that's just that -- your behavior.

Ideally I'd like to kick caffeine (completely if necessary) or only use it for performance purpose, pending the above results.

- sleep duration
- sleep quality
- blue light exposure (time of last exposure before bed)
- technology use (time of last phone / laptop use before bed)
- meditation (time of pre-bed yoga / meditation)
- consistent bed-time (minutes over / under)
- consistent wake-time (minutes over / under)
- number of strategies employed

Tentative Research:

- Insomnia increases:  blood glucose, blood pressure, and waist circumference ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404954))
- Does blood sugar slow recovery?
  - increased blood sugar > increased inflammation > IGF-1 + host of other problems (above) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820068/))
  - low IGF-1 plus chronic inflammation = major destruction to body (ref. above)
- Magnesium

> "Interestingly, magnesium has been shown to exert, as IGF-1 does, beneficial independent actions on muscle function and could play a role on physical performance in the elderly. This hypothesis is consistent with clinical and epidemiologic data supporting the importance of the magnesium ion as a determinant of muscle performance in young subjects." (ref. above)

- Selenium

> "There is increasing evidence that selenium could influence skeletal muscle function even if its role in maintaining functional muscle efficiency is still unclear." (ref. above); Selenium is also related to production of thyroid hormone T3.

- Zinc

> "Zinc is involved in growth, protein and DNA synthesis, neuro-sensory functions, cell-mediated immunity, thyroid function, and bone metabolism"... zinc seems also to be involved in nutritional regulation of IGF-1 bioactivity. In cultured bone cells, some studies suggest that zinc potentiates the action of IGF-1 and increases endogenous IGF-1 synthesis." (ref. above)

- Testosterone

* Tim Ferris (4HB, p.258):  2 x 10 min cold shower / day; 6,000 - 10,000 IU / day sunlight.
* Cold showers won't do anything for testosterone that exercise won't ([r](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-shower-testosterone#summary)), but may still benefit recovery (pending current results).
* Vitamin D may still increase testosterone ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154195)).

* Sleep Baseline, monitored via [Prime Nap app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.primenap). -- 7 day average (picture reference).
    * Sleep Time:
    * REM %:
    * Deep Sleep %:

**Potassium and Sodium Ratio / Blood Pressure (follow up):**

* ratios upwards of 1:1, 2:1, 3.5:1 on paleo ([r](https://paleoleap.com/sodium-potassium-paleo/))
* consider [potassium BHB supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Potassium-Exogenous-Supplement-Beta-Hydroxybutyrate/dp/B06W9KFYFF/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=potassium+bhb&qid=1587208418&sr=8-5) and measure with cognitive performance (test?)
* reintroduce general electrolyte supplement to alter ratio

**Caffeine and Triglycerides:**

* The "Ultimate Bloodwork" epidose of the Fundamental Health Podcast ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/The-ULTIMATE-bloodwork-podcast!-id2108592-id183111720?country=us)) mentions caffeine within 24 hours can raise cortisol (obviously), but triglycerides as well ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-impact-of-coffee-on-triglycerides/)).  As noted elsewhere I drink a fair amount of coffee, but my triglyceride to HDL ratio is 1.47 : 1 which is pretty darn good.
* Pending the results of my test of caffeine as a PED, I may eliminate caffeine entirely.

**Intermitent Fasting:**

* typical protocols ([r](https://perfectketo.com/types-intermittent-fasting/))
    * 14 - 18 horus
    * test: 16/8 window
    * test: 5:2 days, 5 days regular 3 meals, 2 days single meal
* I'm not particularly interested in IF, though it's been frequently requested that I look at it next.  There are some benefits to IF (increased autophagy, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased inflamation; ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/))).  As for insulin resistance and inflamation, see above regarding blood sugar and ketones.  At my current training rate, certainly before the COVID-19 scare, and thereby gross recovery need, I wasn't concerned with autophagy either.  Nor am I convinced that IF would give a benefit greater than the protocols I've already mentioned.  IF can also aid in weight loss, though I suspect this is largely due to portion control.  I'm very happy with my current weight and body composition (160 - 165 lbs, < 10% body fat)
* There are also potential drawbacks of which specifcally have to do with strength gains related to IGF1 ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/)).  In short, I'm happy with my weight / composition and want to get stronger more than I want to get lighter / leaner.

**Super Stupid Simple Cardio:**

* 3 x 10 min walk / day (after meals)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-to-become-as-strong-as-possible-with-Stan-Efferding-id2108592-id207121110?country=us))
* wear a (light) weight vest around the house?  mowing the yard?
* I'm not terribly concerned with my conditioning, given my RHR and VO2 max.  However, I'll follow up after my current tests and potentially establish a "maintenance" cardio routine and skip this study.

**Fat Cycling / Competition Prep:**

* Kevin Stock recommends cutting back fat at least one meal / day (up to all meals / day) for two days, then eating one "regular" day ([r](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/fat-loss-and-the-carnivore-diet/)).
