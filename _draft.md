**Anecdotes / Observations:**

* no immediate / "supper Buddha" mental / cognitive benefits.  However, closing in on 60 days, in spite of work insecurity and the COVID-19 crisis, I have to say overall mood is possibly the best it's been in the last 5 years.  Similar to the effect I got when using a full spectrum CBD oil (Receptra Naturals Recovery formula), not manic or elevated in energy, just a little more levity in my overall mindset and mood.
  *  not coincidentally, this made me more aware if increased irritability (no noticeable increase in anxiety) with the large caffeine doses (+600mg).
