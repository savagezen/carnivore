title: Future Tests

---

**Queue / Pending Follow Up:**

* 90 day blood panel (~5/14/20)
* [75 Hard challenge](https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/) (~7/4/20)
* sleep quality and measures
* Caffeine and Triglycerides (pending caffeine / performance results)
* Blood Pressure and Sodium:Potassium Ratio (f/u)

**Consideration:**

* Water Filter / Testosterone?

---

**Potassium and Sodium Ratio / Blood Pressure (follow up):**

* ratios upwards of 1:1, 2:1, 3.5:1 on paleo ([r](https://paleoleap.com/sodium-potassium-paleo/))
* consider [potassium BHB supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Potassium-Exogenous-Supplement-Beta-Hydroxybutyrate/dp/B06W9KFYFF/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=potassium+bhb&qid=1587208418&sr=8-5) and measure with cognitive performance (test?)
* reintroduce general electrolyte supplement to alter ratio

---

**Caffeine and Triglycerides:**

* The "Ultimate Bloodwork" epidose of the Fundamental Health Podcast ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/The-ULTIMATE-bloodwork-podcast!-id2108592-id183111720?country=us)) mentions caffeine within 24 hours can raise cortisol (obviously), but triglycerides as well ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-impact-of-coffee-on-triglycerides/)).  As noted elsewhere I drink a fair amount of coffee, but my triglyceride to HDL ratio is 1.47 : 1 which is pretty darn good.
* Pending the results of my test of caffeine as a PED, I may eliminate caffeine entirely.

---

**Super Stupid Simple Cardio:**

* 3 x 10 min walk / day (after meals)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-to-become-as-strong-as-possible-with-Stan-Efferding-id2108592-id207121110?country=us))
* wear a (light) weight vest around the house?  mowing the yard?
* I'm not terribly concerned with my conditioning, given my RHR and VO2 max.  However, I'll follow up after my current tests and potentially establish a "maintenance" cardio routine and skip this study.

---

**Fat Cycling / Competition Prep:**

* Kevin Stock recommends cutting back fat at least one meal / day (up to all meals / day) for two days, then eating one "regular" day ([r](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/fat-loss-and-the-carnivore-diet/)).

**Sleep Research:** 

Training hard = easy
Recover hard = discipline
The better / faster you recover, the harder / more you can train.  You're not getting the most out of your next workout or training session if you haven't recovered from the last one -- think about digging another hole before the last one's healed.. that's the path to injury!

Best / Cheapest Recovery =? sleep
* we all have to sleep anyway
* obviously we recover when we sleep
* lack of sleep has lots of detriments: increased risk of heart disease, hormone imbalance, mood dysregulation, etc... ([r](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation).[r](https://www.healthline.com/health/sleep-deprivation/effects-on-body#1))
* what improves sleep? ([r](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips)[r]((https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/six-tips-design-ideal-bedroom-sleep)))
    * consistent bed / wake time -- costs nothing
    * avoid screens (meditate / read)  -- costs nothing
    * avoid coffee / nicotine / other drugs (at least 8 hours) before bed -- costs nothing, actually saves money
    * exercise, nap, and eat (your biggest meal) earlier in the day -- costs nothing but planning
    * drink only enough to not be thirsty when waking (try to avoid trips to the bathroom at night)
    * the darker, colder, and quieter the room, the better -- takes some investment
* Consulting with a sleep lab, phone apps are only about 60% accurate, being based on heart rate and movement (e.g. if your heart rate is low and you're not moving the apps think you're asleep even if you're not).
* In my experience a simple 1-5 rating scale seems just as accurate

* Saunas?
   *  probably sweating PLENTY through BJJ

* Massage?
  *  master sleep first, maybe 75 hard v2

* CVS Cholesterol Screening [$60](https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/price-lists)
* CVS Comprehensive Screening [$60]()
* Home Testosterone Test [$60](https://www.cvs.com/shop/everlywell-testosterone-test-prodid-1860032)
    * Insulin sensitivity correlates positively with testosterone (Fundamental Health - Blue Zones are a myth)
    * if shbg / free is high, may be insulin sensitive
    * free and total
    * if total is low, there's a problem
    * urine tests may have validity issues due to metabolism of testosterone in blood
    * normal range: total 617, free 12.3, shbg 35.5, [r](https://alpha-med.net/blog/f/what-are-normal-testosterone-levels)
