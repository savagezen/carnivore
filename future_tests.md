#### Ongoing Tests:

**Caffeine and Performance:**

* Tentative Research:
  * 3-9 mg / kg @ 60 min (typically I weight 160 - 165 lbs, 72 - 74 kg) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5752738/))
  * consider dosage and time prior to exercise
  * apparently I'm in the genotype Rs5751876-c:  reduced ergogenic effect / reduced sleep quality; article suggests lower dose or increase time before exercise
  * 3mg/kg (~200 mg, 6 mg/kg (~400 mg), 9 mg/kg (~650 mg)
  * run each 3/6/9 dosage each at 30/60/90 min pre-workout
  * randomize doasge and timing to control for adaptation (getting stronger)
* Results (correlation and regression)
  * dependent variable = strength output test (timed 500 kb + 75 push press swing @ 20#, for time)
  * control = adaptation (% work days / total days in trial)
  * control : strength output
  * caffeine dose (mg) : strength output 
  * caffeine time (minutes first dose and start of exercise) : strength output
  * caffeine ratio (mg / minute) : strength output
  * electorlytes (Na, Ca, K, Mg) : strength output

**Cold Showers and Recovery:**

* Tentative Research: [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025014/), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745760/)
  * cold w/in 1 hour:  you'll feel better but perform worse (duh!)
  * cold and cold+active w/in 24 and 48 hours:  less sore, but no significant change in performance
  * RHR may stay lower, longer when cold is followed by exercise
  * track training hours, RHR, soreness, fatigue
  * may take up to 6 - 12 weeks for fulll effect
* Results (correlation and regression)
   * dependent variable = strength output test (above)
   * control_1 = rest (% of rest days / total days in trial)
   * control_2 = training load (strength output test * percieved difficulty[1-5 scale, 5 high])
   * time in cold shower : perceived soreness (1-5 scale, 5 high, morning after)
   * time in cold shower : perceived fatigue (1-5 scale, 5 high, morning after)
   * time in cold shower : resting heart rate (morning after as a indicator of recovery)
   * control_1 : perceived soreness
   * control_1 : perceived fatigue
   * control_1 : resting heart rate
   * control_2 : perceived soreness
   * control_2 : perceived fatigue
   * control_2 : resting heart rate
   * eelctrolytes (Na, Mg, Ca, K) : perceived soreness
   * electrolytes (Na, Mg, Ca, K) : perceived fatigue
   * electrolytes (Na, Mg, Ca, K) : resting heart rate
 
**Fat:Protein Ratio and Blood Glucose**

* Tentative Research
  * typically my blood sugar is aroudn 100, whcih is good, but higher on carnivore than keto (87).  For the later, my fat:protein ration was over 3:1 and close to 4:1 soemtimes.  Prior to this test, on carnivore, fat:protein ratio is about 1:1 or slightly higher.
  * too much protein starts to create glucose through gluconeogenesis.  typically not a problem on keto, but when eating significantly more protein (carnivore) it is -- 50 - 80 g of glucose per 100 g protein ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Does-protein-cause-cancer--Dr.-Gabrielle-Lyon-id2108592-id217457513?country=us),[r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636610/)).
  * the more I think about it, the more I like the metaphor of the blood stream as a highway; whcih is accurate from cholesterol to surgar to vitamins and minerals.  i.e. less traffic jams from sugar and insulin, more efficient use of other nutrients.
  * increased ketones can decrease triglycerides and insulin resistance (though positively correlated with glucose) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074331/)) while reducing fatigue / overuse of IGF1 ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059164/)) -- we need that to be fluid and efficiently used to get stronger!
  * I know ketones are good, just not convinced that more is better, whcih is why I'm focusing in glucose / insulin ([r](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/the-ketone-craze-who-really-benefits-from-high-ketone-levels),[r](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373631)).  Recommended ranges of ketones are from 0.5 - 3 mmol/L (9 - 54 mg/dL), though ancestrally levels were probably between 0.1 and 1 ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-Broccoli-is-Destroying-Your-Thyroid!-With-Elle-Russ-id2108592-id236477377?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=web_share&utm_content=How%20Broccoli%20is%20Destroying%20Your%20Thyroid!%20With%20Elle%20Russ-CastBox_FM)).  Usually I am in the 5 - 15 mg/dL range (urine).  It's pretty easy to pee on a stick though, so it's worth keeping track of.
* Results (correlation and regression)
  * fat ratio (calories from fat / calories from protein) : fasted blood sugar (fasted 9-12 hours)
  * fat ratio : urine ketones

#### Other Changes:

**Beef and Salt Only:**

* Why:
  * too easy to go too much with butter ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Does-LDL-cause-heart-disease--With-Ivor-Cummins-id2108592-id224835368?country=us))
  * free range eggs ARE nutrient dense, but ARE NOT cost effective compared to beef (muscle and organs)
  * pork and chicken tend to be higher in O6; ([r](http://paleozonenutrition.com/2011/05/10/omega-6-and-3-in-nuts-oils-meat-and-fish-tools-to-get-it-right/)), bison and lamb are okay
  * as for fish, I made an instagram post about the electrolyte content in canned mackerel ([1368mg NA, 870mg CA, 700mg K](https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-cannedpackaged-fish-jack-mackerel-canned-drained/vW4oYfeySgK_Ny4wfLddvA)), but the mercury / slenium content was also brought to my attention ([r](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/10/can-eating-the-wrong-fish-put-you-at-higher-risk-for-mercury-exposure/index.htm)).  This is a frequnt argument against (certainly large amounts) canned tuna.  Effectively, fish will be removed from my diet, not becasue they're all *bad*, but because the lowest-mercury fish don't have enough fat (even salmon).  It's easy to find sardines canned in olive oil, but that is un-carnivore.  Again, not necessarily "bad", in fact "good" by most measures, just not part of my current protocol.

**Intermitent Fasting:**

* typical protocols ([r](https://perfectketo.com/types-intermittent-fasting/))
  * 14 - 18 horus
  * test: 16/8 window
  * test: 5:2 days, 5 days regular 3 meals, 2 days single meal
* I'm not particularly interested in IF, though it's been frequently requested that I look at it next.  There are some benefits to IF (increased autophagy, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased inflamation; ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/))).  As for insulin resistance and inflamation, see above regarding blood sugar and ketones.  At my current training rate, certainly before the COVID-19 scare, and thereby gross recovery need, I wasn't concerned with autophagy either.  Nor am I convinced that IF would give a benefit greater than the protocols I've already mentioned.  IF can also aid in weight loss, though I suspect this is largely due to portion control.  I'm very happy with my current weight and body composition (160 - 165 lbs, < 10% body fat)
* There are also potential drawbacks of which specifcally have to do with strength gains related to IGF1 ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/)).  In short, I'm happy with my weight / composition and want to get stronger more than I want to get lighter / leaner.
