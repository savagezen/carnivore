#### Carnivore Stats

A statistical analysis of a carnivore diet.

**Caffeine:**

Looking at the output from R, the significance (p) of the relatinoship between sleep quality and last time of caffeine ingestion was 0.0068 (not significant).
However, the significance of the relationship between total caffeine (mg) ingested throughout the day and sleep quality was 0.439 (very significant).  The correlation strength (r) between sleep quality and total caffeine was -0.22.  That is, as total caffeine ingestion increase, sleep quality decreased significantly.

This was pretty intersting because I suspected that the last time of use would have a ver significant impact on sleep quality due to the long half life of caffeine.
However, the data does not indicate that.  After looking at the raw data, before running any calculations, I suspected that perhaps the dosage mattered in the sense of 600 mg (in the form of back to back energy drinks) versus 6 x 100mg doses throughout the day (one cup of coffee at a time).
This may still be true, but it is clear that the total dosage (intake during the day) impacts sleep quality greatly.

Follow up could study could look at variance in dosage volume and frequency.
