**Introduction:**

Welcome to my statistical review of the carnivore diet.  See the index below as well as my [other nutritional and sport recovery studies](https://lintr.ee/savagezen).  Other supporting documents include a [raw data public spreadsheet on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13WCRykhYSVscl9QhU4B3CNdaC7-n2UEKnWZBDMZJoBs/edit?usp=sharing) and a [Google Photos ablum](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jrqqa6PNoXXHvM3m6) with macro / micro nutrient profiles and blood panels.

**Background:**

Many moons ago, circa 2008, I began scowering bodybuilding forums to supplement my wrestling training.  In 2010 I found my self carrying over 200 lbs on my 5'8" frame.  I started training boxing, BJJ, and MMA then, and in 2011 took a more serious look at my diet.

I started to ditch the "bro-science" and be more methodical, picking up a copy of Tim Ferriss's *The Four Hour Body*.  It wasn't too long then until I transitioned to Robb Wolf's *Paleo Solution* and Mark Sisson's *Primal Blueprint.*  And so I set out on my paleo path hapily from 2012 - 2019.

There was some experimenting along the way, including a vegeterian and even raw vegetarian stint, as well as some hang ups and regressions -- life is tough and rife with unexpected challenges.

I stopped training combat sports in 2013 and at the end of 2018 I decided I wanted to return.  My frist endeavor was to "get back to my fighting weight" (e.g. about 160-165 lbs.).  I went back to a strict paleo food list, but added ketogenic macronutrients (70% fat, 20% protein, and 10% carbs) as a last bet to "see if I was ready to back."  Well I did.

That went well for all of 2019, except I found myself in a flurry of ups and downs, sometimes creeping back up to 170 lbs.  I always seemed to be working in more and more bars and shakes; and I never could completely divorce junk food.  I often debated a negotiated different cheat meal schedules.

Eventually I felt I'd gone too far in that direction (fat bombs, gross amounts of liquid calories, junk cravings, etc...) and by nature of the plaeo / primal / keto circles I travel in, stumbled upon the carnivore diet.  Sketpical as anyone at first -- we *need* vegetables right! right? -- and an adamant self-tester, I decided I could try anything for 30-days, measure the outcomes, and analyze my next step.

And so it began.
