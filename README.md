#### Carnivore Stats

A statistical analysis of a carnivore diet.

**Caffeine:**

In this sub-test of 15 samples, I looked at how caffeine dosage (total mg / day) and last time of ingestion effected sleep quality (simple 1-5 scale).  One note on the raw data (link below) is that the caffeine / sleep samples were taken on consecutive days.  They do not correspond to the dates and other values on the spreadsheet.  I.E.  the caffeine / sleep samples were taken on 15 consecutive days, but the other values were only being monitored and documented three times per week.

At any rate, dosage did not have a significant relationship (p < 0.01) with either sleep quality or time of ingestion.  However, last time of ingestion had a notably significant relationship with sleep quality (p = 0.0068).  The strength of the relationship was also notable (r = -0.67).  This means that the later in the day caffeine was ingested, the more poor sleep quality was.

While the relationship between time of ingestion and dosage was not statistically significant, it was close (p = 0.0123) and the correlation was strong (r = 0.63) suggestion that the later in the day you consume caffeine, the higher your total dosage for the day is (which makes sense).  Follow up analysis could include comparing different dosages at different times (e.g. 600mg all within a one hour window versus over a 6 hour window; and again 6 hours in the am versus, etc...).
