60 day carnivore studies (draft)

---

**General Protocol:**

* nose-to-tail carnivore diet
    * main (ruminant): beef (liver, kidney, ground, roast, brisket), bone broth (made from scratch), lamb, suet, tallow, eggs (yolk only)
    * inclusions (minimal):  pork (< 1 oz / day each) , butter
    * exclusions: chicken
    * supplements: see acknowledgments below

**Explanations:**

* I feel it is too easy to overdo it with butter / liquid fats (a large reason for my shift from keto to carnivore)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Does-LDL-cause-heart-disease--With-Ivor-Cummins-id2108592-id224835368?country=us)).  
* Free range eggs are very nutrient dense, but not cost effective compared to beef organs.  I'm also looking at the effects of increasing my fat:protein ratio.  
* Pork and chicken tend to have a higher Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio ([r](http://paleozonenutrition.com/2011/05/10/omega-6-and-3-in-nuts-oils-meat-and-fish-tools-to-get-it-right/)) compared to ruminants.  
* Regarding fish, I previously noted the electrolytes in mackerel, but I more recently became aware of the heavy mineral content (the same concern arises with tuna)([r](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/10/can-eating-the-wrong-fish-put-you-at-higher-risk-for-mercury-exposure/index.htm)).  Low mercury fish tend to be lower in fat (compared again to ruminants), which as mentioned above, I am trying to manipulate and increase.

**Caffeine and Performance:**

* Tentative Research:
  * 3-9 mg / kg @ 60 min (typically I weight 160 - 165 lbs, 72 - 74 kg) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5752738/))
  * consider dosage and time prior to exercise
  * apparently I'm in the genotype Rs5751876-c:  reduced ergogenic effect / reduced sleep quality; article suggests lower dose or increase time before exercise
  * 3mg/kg (~200 mg, 6 mg/kg (~400 mg), 9 mg/kg (~650 mg)
  * run each 3/6/9 dosage each at 30/60/90 min pre-workout
  * randomize doasge and timing to control for adaptation (getting stronger).

> Results (correlation and regression):
>  Dependent variable = strength output test (timed 500 kb + 75 push press swing @ 20#, for time)

**Recovery - Cold Showers, Adaptation , Sleep, and Testosterone Variables:**

* Tentative Research - Cold Showers: ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025014/), [r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745760/))
  * cold w/in 1 hour:  you'll feel better but perform worse (duh!)
  * cold and cold+active w/in 24 and 48 hours:  less sore, but no significant change in performance
  * RHR may stay lower, longer when cold is followed by exercise
  * track training hours, RHR, soreness, fatigue
  * may take up to 6 - 12 weeks for fulll effect
  * randomize cold time to control for adaptation (0-5)

* Tentative Research - Sleep:
  * Insomnia increases:  blood glucose, blood pressure, and waist circumference ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404954))
  * Does blood sugar slow recovery?
  * increased blood sugar > increased inflammation > IGF-1 + host of other problems (above) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820068/))
  * low IGF-1 plus chronic inflammation = major destruction to body (ref. above)

   * Magnesium - "Interestingly, magnesium has been shown to exert, as IGF-1 does, beneficial independent actions on muscle function and could play a role on physical performance in the elderly. This hypothesis is consistent with clinical and epidemiologic data supporting the importance of the magnesium ion as a determinant of muscle performance in young subjects." (ref. above)
   * Selenium - "There is increasing evidence that selenium could influence skeletal muscle function even if its role in maintaining functional muscle efficiency is still unclear." (ref. above); Selenium is also related to production of thyroid hormone T3.
   * Zinc - "Zinc is involved in growth, protein and DNA synthesis, neuro-sensory functions, cell-mediated immunity, thyroid function, and bone metabolism"... zinc seems also to be involved in nutritional regulation of IGF-1 bioactivity. In cultured bone cells, some studies suggest that zinc potentiates the action of IGF-1 and increases endogenous IGF-1 synthesis." (ref. above)

* Tentative Research - Testosterone:
    * Tim Ferris (4HB, p.258):  2 x 10 min cold shower / day; 6,000 - 10,000 IU / day sunlight.
    * Cold showers won't do anything for testosterone that exercise won't ([r](https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-shower-testosterone#summary)), but may still benefit recovery (pending current results).
    * Vitamin D may still increase testosterone ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154195)).  You get 10,000 - 20,000 IU / 30 minutes ([r]([https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-from-sun#time-of-day](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-from-sun#time-of-day))).

**Fat:Protein Ratio and Blood Sugar / Ketones:**

* Tentative Research
  * typically my blood sugar is aroudn 100, whcih is good, but higher on carnivore than keto (87).  For the later, my fat:protein ration was over 3:1 and close to 4:1 soemtimes.  Prior to this test, on carnivore, fat:protein ratio is about 1:1 or slightly higher.
  * too much protein starts to create glucose through gluconeogenesis.  typically not a problem on keto, but when eating significantly more protein (carnivore) it is -- 50 - 80 g of glucose per 100 g protein ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Does-protein-cause-cancer--Dr.-Gabrielle-Lyon-id2108592-id217457513?country=us),[r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636610/)).
  * the more I think about it, the more I like the metaphor of the blood stream as a highway; whcih is accurate from cholesterol to surgar to vitamins and minerals.  i.e. less traffic jams from sugar and insulin, more efficient use of other nutrients.
  * increased ketones can decrease triglycerides and insulin resistance (though positively correlated with glucose) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074331/)) while reducing fatigue / overuse of IGF1 ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059164/)) -- we need that to be fluid and efficiently used to get stronger!
  * I know ketones are good, just not convinced that more is better, whcih is why I'm focusing in glucose / insulin ([r](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/the-ketone-craze-who-really-benefits-from-high-ketone-levels),[r](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373631)).  Recommended ranges of ketones are from 0.5 - 3 mmol/L (9 - 54 mg/dL), though ancestrally levels were probably between 0.1 and 1 ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-Broccoli-is-Destroying-Your-Thyroid!-With-Elle-Russ-id2108592-id236477377?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=web_share&utm_content=How%20Broccoli%20is%20Destroying%20Your%20Thyroid!%20With%20Elle%20Russ-CastBox_FM)).  Usually I am in the 5 - 15 mg/dL range (urine).  It's pretty easy to pee on a stick though, so it's worth keeping track of.
  * blood glucose corresponding to the above urine ketones would be 40 - 75 mg/dL (fasted); less than 40 or over 200 being dangerous, but over 75 (for sure over 100), being non-conducive to ketosis ([r](https://www.thebonesandco.com/blog/ketosis-versus-ketoacidosis-dogs)).
   * Ketones alone may not be good indicator (e.g. less excreted in urine if they're getting used in the blood)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Supersoldiers-and-enhanced-cognitive-function-with-ketones!-A-conversation-with-Dominic-D%E2%80%99Agostino%2C-PhD-id2108592-id171881127?country=us)).

**Electrolytes and Cardiovascular Load (follow up):**

Robb Wolf ([r](https://robbwolf.com/2019/02/27/is-there-a-thing-as-too-much-sodium/)) and Mark Sisson ([r](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/salt-what-is-it-good-for/)) have suggested on many occasions that for low carb athletes, 3-5g / day of sodium is not unusual and that the "upper limit" (particularly hot and humid environments) may require upwards of 7g / day.  Paul Saladino and Robb Wolf had a good discussion about sodium on [The Fundamental Health Podcast](https://castbox.fm/episode/Carnivore-vs-Fruitarians.-A-friendly-debate-with-Robby-and-Cyrus-from-Mastering-Diabetes.-id2108592-id231687037?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=web_share&utm_content=Carnivore%20vs%20Fruitarians.%20A%20friendly%20debate%20with%20Robby%20and%20Cyrus%20from%20Mastering%20Diabetes.-CastBox_FM) where Paul speculates that ancestrally we consumed about 3g sodium per day.  However, the did come to the consensus that environment (humidity) and intensity of activity matter greatly.

I have done previous research on sodium ([r](https://lnk.bio/go?d=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsavagezen%2Fsavagezen.github.io%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F_posts%2F2019-03-08-blood-pressure-01.md&id=639762&hash=5f3fc6788793ec4cf7bf77ab5677c6ea&timezone=America/New_York),[r](https://lnk.bio/go?d=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1IU5-A1XtKTGN1AyGS6J562pRoQ8XduEmuM1_xzhbaz8%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&id=639759&hash=e2383784c9180a5ab50c103d068e44ad&timezone=America/New_York)) which was somewhat inconclusive.  Reducing sodium didn't help my blood pressure, though it hurt my recovery and overall functioning.  However, increasing my sodium helped my recovery and functioning, but didn't hurt my blood pressure.  Of note too, my sodium fixation began in 2019, but I really started ramping it up that summer; but again I was doing 10 hours of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu per week in August in Georgia (USA).

Recently too, I've taken an interest in cardiovascular load (mean arterial pressure * resting heart rate) over blood pressure alone.  Something else I haven't considered is caffeine.  My usage fluctuates greatly.  I may be on a "detox" phase where I'm only drinking 3 - 4 cups / day; or I may be in a critical work period (mental health) and consuming upwards of 6 cups per day.  This also doesn't include caffeine use as a performance enhancing drug (see above).  So, it's worth noting that caffeine causes us to deplete sodium at about 3.3 - 4.8 (mean 4.05) mg / mg of caffeine ([r](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-coffee-healthier-by-adding-salt-the-salt-fix-james-dinicolantonio)).  So, if I were drinking 4 cups of per day then I'd need 1,600 mg of sodium just to cover caffeine depletion and at least 4,600 mg / day (3,000 + 1,600).  With all those numbers thrown around, and a lot of variance between then, when environmental and depletion factors are considered, [my 6-7g](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jrqqa6PNoXXHvM3m6) / day is a rather sane amount.

I have briefly looked at electrolytes overall, but have been curious about sodium : potassium ratio as well; something I can easily incorporate into the follow up study -- as well as total electrolyte balance.

**Anecdotes / Observations:**

* no immediate / "supper Buddha" mental / cognitive benefits.  However, closing in on 60 days, in spite of work insecurity and the COVID-19 crisis, I have to say overall mood is possibly the best it's been in the last 5 years.  Similar to the effect I got when using a full spectrum CBD oil (Receptra Naturals Recovery formula), not manic or elevated in energy, just a little more levity in my overall mindset and mood.
  *  not coincidentally, this made me more aware if increased irritability (no noticeable increase in anxiety) with the large caffeine doses (+600mg).
* 4/20/20 - 66 days into my carnivore journey I started, and a week into my "mega study" on performance and recovery, I started the [Carnivore 75 Hard]([https://www.google.com/search?q=carnivore75hard&source=lmns&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS893US893&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwiqu53hpPboAhUQQFMKHY_WB9wQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA&safe=active&ssui=on](https://www.google.com/search?q=carnivore75hard&source=lmns&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS893US893&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwiqu53hpPboAhUQQFMKHY_WB9wQ_AUoAHoECAEQAA&safe=active&ssui=on)) challenge.
