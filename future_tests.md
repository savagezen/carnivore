#### Ongoing Tests:

**Caffeine and Performance:**

* Tentative Research:
  * 3-9 mg / kg @ 60 min (typically I weight 160 - 165 lbs, 72 - 74 kg) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5752738/))
  * consider dosage and time prior to exercise
  * apparently I'm in the genotype Rs5751876-c:  reduced ergogenic effect / reduced sleep quality; article suggests lower dose or increase time before exercise
  * 3mg/kg (~200 mg, 6 mg/kg (~400 mg), 9 mg/kg (~650 mg)
  * run each 3/6/9 dosage each at 30/60/90 min pre-workout
  * randomize doasge and timing to control for adaptation (getting stronger): 1d10
  * | Roll | Dose | Time |
| 1 | 200 mg | 30 min |
| 2 | 200 mg | 60 min |
| 3 | 200 mg | 90 min |
| 4 | 400 mg | 30 min |
| 5 | 400 mg | 60 min |

**Fat:Protein Ratio and Blood Glucose**

* Tentative Research
  * typically my blood sugar is aroudn 100, whcih is good, but higher on carnivore than keto (87).  For the later, my fat:protein ration was over 3:1 and close to 4:1 soemtimes.  Prior to this test, on carnivore, fat:protein ratio is about 1:1 or slightly higher.
  * too much protein starts to create glucose through gluconeogenesis.  typically not a problem on keto, but when eating significantly more protein (carnivore) it is -- 50 - 80 g of glucose per 100 g protein ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Does-protein-cause-cancer--Dr.-Gabrielle-Lyon-id2108592-id217457513?country=us),[r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3636610/)).
  * the more I think about it, the more I like the metaphor of the blood stream as a highway; whcih is accurate from cholesterol to surgar to vitamins and minerals.  i.e. less traffic jams from sugar and insulin, more efficient use of other nutrients.
  * increased ketones can decrease triglycerides and insulin resistance (though positively correlated with glucose) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7074331/)) while reducing fatigue / overuse of IGF1 ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7059164/)) -- we need that to be fluid and efficiently used to get stronger!
  * I know ketones are good, just not convinced that more is better, whcih is why I'm focusing in glucose / insulin ([r](https://ketodietapp.com/Blog/lchf/the-ketone-craze-who-really-benefits-from-high-ketone-levels),[r](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyperglycemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373631)).  Recommended ranges of ketones are from 0.5 - 3 mmol/L (9 - 54 mg/dL), though ancestrally levels were probably between 0.1 and 1 ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-Broccoli-is-Destroying-Your-Thyroid!-With-Elle-Russ-id2108592-id236477377?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=web_share&utm_content=How%20Broccoli%20is%20Destroying%20Your%20Thyroid!%20With%20Elle%20Russ-CastBox_FM)).  Usually I am in the 5 - 15 mg/dL range (urine).  It's pretty easy to pee on a stick though, so it's worth keeping track of.
* Results (correlation and regression)
  * fat ratio (calories from fat / calories from protein) : fasted blood sugar (fasted 9-12 hours)
  * fat ratio : urine ketones
  

**Electrolytes and Cardiovascular Load (follow up):

Robb Wolf ([r](https://robbwolf.com/2019/02/27/is-there-a-thing-as-too-much-sodium/)) and Mark Sisson ([r](https://www.marksdailyapple.com/salt-what-is-it-good-for/)) have suggested on many occasions that for low carb athletes, 3-5g / day of sodium is not unusual and that the "upper limit" (particularly hot and humid environments) may require upwards of 7g / day.  Paul Saladino and Robb Wolf had a good discussion about sodium on [The Fundamental Health Podcast[(https://castbox.fm/episode/Carnivore-vs-Fruitarians.-A-friendly-debate-with-Robby-and-Cyrus-from-Mastering-Diabetes.-id2108592-id231687037?utm_source=website&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=web_share&utm_content=Carnivore%20vs%20Fruitarians.%20A%20friendly%20debate%20with%20Robby%20and%20Cyrus%20from%20Mastering%20Diabetes.-CastBox_FM) where Paul speculates that ancestrally we consumed about 3g sodium per day.  However, the did come to the consensus that environment (humidity) and intensity of activity matter greatly.

I have done previous research on sodium ([r](https://lnk.bio/go?d=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsavagezen%2Fsavagezen.github.io%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F_posts%2F2019-03-08-blood-pressure-01.md&id=639762&hash=5f3fc6788793ec4cf7bf77ab5677c6ea&timezone=America/New_York),[r](https://lnk.bio/go?d=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1IU5-A1XtKTGN1AyGS6J562pRoQ8XduEmuM1_xzhbaz8%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing&id=639759&hash=e2383784c9180a5ab50c103d068e44ad&timezone=America/New_York)) which was somewhat inconclusive.  Reducing sodium didn't help my blood pressure, though it hurt my recovery and overall functioning.  However, increasing my sodium helped my recovery and functioning, but didn't hurt my blood pressure.  Of note too, my sodium fixation began in 2019, but I really started ramping it up that summer; but again I was doing 10 hours of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu per week in August in Georgia (USA).

Recently too, I've taken an interest in cardiovascular load (mean arterial pressure * resting heart rate) over blood pressure alone.  Something else I haven't considered is caffeine.  My usage fluctuates greatly.  I may be on a "detox" phase where I'm only drinking 3 - 4 cups / day; or I may be in a critical work period (mental health) and consuming upwards of 6 cups per day.  This also doesn't include caffeine use as a performance enhancing drug (see above).  So, it's worth noting that caffeine causes us to deplete sodium at about 3.3 - 4.8 (mean 4.05) mg / mg of caffeine ([r](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-coffee-healthier-by-adding-salt-the-salt-fix-james-dinicolantonio)).  So, if I were drinking 4 cups of per day then I'd need 1,600 mg of sodium just to cover caffeine depletion and at least 4,600 mg / day (3,000 + 1,600).  With all those numbers thrown around, and a lot of variance between then, when environmental and depletion factors are considered, [my 6-7g](https://photos.app.goo.gl/jrqqa6PNoXXHvM3m6) / day is a rather sane amount.

I have briefly looked at electrolytes overall, but have been curious about sodium : potassium ratio as well; something I can easily incorporate into the follow up study -- as well as total electrolyte balance.

#### Other Changes and Future Projections:

**Beef and Salt Only:**

* Why:
  * too easy to go too much with butter ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/Does-LDL-cause-heart-disease--With-Ivor-Cummins-id2108592-id224835368?country=us))
  * free range eggs ARE nutrient dense, but ARE NOT cost effective compared to beef (muscle and organs)
  * pork and chicken tend to be higher in O6; ([r](http://paleozonenutrition.com/2011/05/10/omega-6-and-3-in-nuts-oils-meat-and-fish-tools-to-get-it-right/)), bison and lamb are okay
  * as for fish, I made an instagram post about the electrolyte content in canned mackerel ([1368mg NA, 870mg CA, 700mg K](https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-cannedpackaged-fish-jack-mackerel-canned-drained/vW4oYfeySgK_Ny4wfLddvA)), but the mercury / slenium content was also brought to my attention ([r](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/10/can-eating-the-wrong-fish-put-you-at-higher-risk-for-mercury-exposure/index.htm)).  This is a frequnt argument against (certainly large amounts) canned tuna.  Effectively, fish will be removed from my diet, not becasue they're all *bad*, but because the lowest-mercury fish don't have enough fat (even salmon).  It's easy to find sardines canned in olive oil, but that is un-carnivore.  Again, not necessarily "bad", in fact "good" by most measures, just not part of my current protocol.

**Intermitent Fasting:**

* typical protocols ([r](https://perfectketo.com/types-intermittent-fasting/))
  * 14 - 18 horus
  * test: 16/8 window
  * test: 5:2 days, 5 days regular 3 meals, 2 days single meal
* I'm not particularly interested in IF, though it's been frequently requested that I look at it next.  There are some benefits to IF (increased autophagy, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased inflamation; ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/))).  As for insulin resistance and inflamation, see above regarding blood sugar and ketones.  At my current training rate, certainly before the COVID-19 scare, and thereby gross recovery need, I wasn't concerned with autophagy either.  Nor am I convinced that IF would give a benefit greater than the protocols I've already mentioned.  IF can also aid in weight loss, though I suspect this is largely due to portion control.  I'm very happy with my current weight and body composition (160 - 165 lbs, < 10% body fat)
* There are also potential drawbacks of which specifcally have to do with strength gains related to IGF1 ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/)).  In short, I'm happy with my weight / composition and want to get stronger more than I want to get lighter / leaner.


**Caffeine and Triglycerides:**

- ["Ultimate bloodwork" episode of Fundamental Health podcast](https://castbox.fm/episode/The-ULTIMATE-bloodwork-podcast!-id2108592-id183111720?country=us) mentions caffeine within 24 hours can raise cortisol (obviously), but triglycerides as well ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-impact-of-coffee-on-triglycerides/)).  As noted elsewhere I drink a fair amount of coffee, but my triglyceride to HDL ratio is 1.47 : 1 which is pretty darn good.

**Sleep and Recovery:**

This is the largest area of interest for me, especially looking to re-enter the competition scene and being over 30.  Training hard isn't the problem.  Recovering is; and more so as you get older -- not only for injury prevention, but because you're only getting the most out of your training sessions if you're recovered from the last one.  Based on years of tinkering, I feel like my diet is pretty well contained, or certainly leaning towards a point of diminishing returns.

Caffeine is also the last remaining drug I have addiction issues with.  I rarely drink alcohol, even socially, since being a carnivore.  I quit smoking and smokeless tobacco years ago.  I have absolutely no desire to eat junk food -- even the ice cream I love(d?) so much.  I did do a pilot study showing how caffeine impacts sleep.  You can take more drugs (melatonin, CBD, etc...) to counteract the former, but you're in a bad behavior loop if you can't change the root of the issue that's just that -- your behavior.

Ideally I'd like to kick caffeine (completely if necessary) or only use it for performance purpose, pending the above results.

- sleep duration
- sleep quality
- blue light exposure (time of last exposure before bed)
- technology use (time of last phone / laptop use before bed)
- meditation (time of pre-bed yoga / meditation)
- consistent bed-time (minutes over / under)
- consistent wake-time (minutes over / under)
- # strategies employed

Tentative Research:

- Insomnia increases:  blood glucose, blood pressure, and waist circumference ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404954))
- Does blood sugar slow recovery?
  - increased blood sugar > increased inflammation > IGF-1 + host of other problems (above) ([r](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820068/))
  - low IGF-1 plus chronic inflammation = major destruction to body (ref. above)
- Magnesium

> "Interestingly, magnesium has been shown to exert, as IGF-1 does, beneficial independent actions on muscle function and could play a role on physical performance in the elderly. This hypothesis is consistent with clinical and epidemiologic data supporting the importance of the magnesium ion as a determinant of muscle performance in young subjects." (ref. above)

- Selenium

> "There is increasing evidence that selenium could influence skeletal muscle function even if its role in maintaining functional muscle efficiency is still unclear." (ref. above); Selenium is also related to production of thyroid hormone T3.

- Zinc

> "Zinc is involved in growth, protein and DNA synthesis, neuro-sensory functions, cell-mediated immunity, thyroid function, and bone metabolism"... zinc seems also to be involved in nutritional regulation of IGF-1 bioactivity. In cultured bone cells, some studies suggest that zinc potentiates the action of IGF-1 and increases endogenous IGF-1 synthesis." (ref. above)
