title: Future Tests

---

**Queue / Pending Follow Up:**

* 90 day blood panel (~5/14/20)
* [75 Hard challenge](https://nutritionwithjudy.com/carnivore75hard/) (~7/4/20)
* Caffeine and Triglycerides
* Blood Pressure and Sodium:Potassium Ratio (f/u)

---

**Potassium and Sodium Ratio / Blood Pressure (follow up):**

* ratios upwards of 1:1, 2:1, 3.5:1 on paleo ([r](https://paleoleap.com/sodium-potassium-paleo/))
* consider [potassium BHB supplement](https://www.amazon.com/Nutricost-Potassium-Exogenous-Supplement-Beta-Hydroxybutyrate/dp/B06W9KFYFF/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=potassium+bhb&qid=1587208418&sr=8-5) and measure with cognitive performance (test?)
* reintroduce general electrolyte supplement to alter ratio

---

**Caffeine and Triglycerides:**

* The "Ultimate Bloodwork" epidose of the Fundamental Health Podcast ([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/The-ULTIMATE-bloodwork-podcast!-id2108592-id183111720?country=us)) mentions caffeine within 24 hours can raise cortisol (obviously), but triglycerides as well ([r](https://cholesterolcode.com/guest-post-impact-of-coffee-on-triglycerides/)).  As noted elsewhere I drink a fair amount of coffee, but my triglyceride to HDL ratio is 1.47 : 1 which is pretty darn good.
* Pending the results of my test of caffeine as a PED, I may eliminate caffeine entirely.

**Intermitent Fasting:**

* typical protocols ([r](https://perfectketo.com/types-intermittent-fasting/))
    * 14 - 18 horus
    * test: 16/8 window
    * test: 5:2 days, 5 days regular 3 meals, 2 days single meal
* I'm not particularly interested in IF, though it's been frequently requested that I look at it next.  There are some benefits to IF (increased autophagy, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased inflamation; ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/))).  As for insulin resistance and inflamation, see above regarding blood sugar and ketones.  At my current training rate, certainly before the COVID-19 scare, and thereby gross recovery need, I wasn't concerned with autophagy either.  Nor am I convinced that IF would give a benefit greater than the protocols I've already mentioned.  IF can also aid in weight loss, though I suspect this is largely due to portion control.  I'm very happy with my current weight and body composition (160 - 165 lbs, < 10% body fat)
* There are also potential drawbacks of which specifcally have to do with strength gains related to IGF1 ([r](https://perfectketo.com/intermittent-fasting-and-keto/)).  In short, I'm happy with my weight / composition and want to get stronger more than I want to get lighter / leaner.

**Super Stupid Simple Cardio:**

* 3 x 10 min walk / day (after meals)([r](https://castbox.fm/episode/How-to-become-as-strong-as-possible-with-Stan-Efferding-id2108592-id207121110?country=us))
* wear a (light) weight vest around the house?  mowing the yard?
* I'm not terribly concerned with my conditioning, given my RHR and VO2 max.  However, I'll follow up after my current tests and potentially establish a "maintenance" cardio routine and skip this study.

**Fat Cycling / Competition Prep:**

* Kevin Stock recommends cutting back fat at least one meal / day (up to all meals / day) for two days, then eating one "regular" day ([r](https://www.kevinstock.io/health/fat-loss-and-the-carnivore-diet/)).
